### Hi there 👋, just call me Adi or Nandra

An Apple fanboy who is wondering to become an enterprise application expert. As a game changer for more than 10 years in informatics engineering which have been applied on many industries, my specializations are in digital platform and middleware. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Indonesian wireless network provider PT. Telekomunikasi Selular (Telkomsel) as Sr. Specialist
- 🌱 I’m currently speaking for reactive systems with Go and Java
- 💡 I’m looking to collaborate on open source and cloud development
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am writing a code only for special occasion, just too busy with my holiday~
- 💬 Prefer for remote working job, writing markdown, and have a "consultant soul" deep in my mind

A detail person, well documented, love to be involved on design and architecture, a brain stormer, challenger, willing to do the best practice, avoid redundant work, and a problem solver.
