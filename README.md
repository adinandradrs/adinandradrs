### Hi there 👋, just call me Adi or Nandra

An Apple fanboy who is wondering to become an enterprise application expert, spelling a bad mantra with his VSCode. As a game changer for more than 10 years in informatics engineering which have been applied on many industries, my specializations are in digital platform and middleware. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Indonesian wireless network provider PT. Telekomunikasi Selular (Telkomsel) as DevSecOps Architect
- 🌱 I’m reactively speaking in Go and Java with its various components 
- 💡 I’m looking to collaborate on open source tools, CI/CD automation, and cloud development
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am writing a code only for special occasion as I'm too busy to think about my holiday :p
- 💬 Prefer for remote working, writing docs on markdown, and do something that could satisfy my "consultant" soul
- 📫 How to reach me? Check my sosmed links!
 
A detail person, well documented, love to be involved on design and architecture, a brain stormer, challenger, willing to do the best practice, avoid redundant work, and a problem solver.
